Example:

We created a free course to create your first GraphQL server (from scratch) using Node and TypeScript. TypeScript and GraphQL are a powerful combo, but there's a lot of confusing edges if you're getting it setup the first time.

In this course we cover the basics of getting TypeScript setup with Node, how GraphQL works, and how to set up a GraphQL server using Apollo server. It's two hours long, it comes with complete code examples, and we walk through the code step-by-step.

It's taught by my friend, Shopify-engineer Hassan Djirdeh and he's integrated what he's learned using GraphQL in production as an engineer at Shopify. We've already had over 1,300 students enroll and it's been getting great reviews so far.
