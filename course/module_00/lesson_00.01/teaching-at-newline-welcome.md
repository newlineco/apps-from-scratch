Our goal is to help programmers learn what they need to be amazing at work and I've got a ton to share with you about how we make this happen. 

The next few videos will give you a deeper explanation of our process, and how it's worked for the authors who came before you, our goals, how long it's going to take, how much money you can make, and what the next steps are.

But let's talk next steps.

The next steps are that you're going to watch the following videos and then you'll to put together an outline and send it to us.

We only publish a limited number of books and courses every year, so we're really selective about what projects we choose to do. But I want you to be successful and the videos I'm going to send will explain how we think about outlining, but more than that, how we think about our goal of helping programmers be amazing at work.

Putting together a good outline is a lot of work, and my goal the next few videos is to first help you decide if you want to work with us. Then you'll put together an outline and send it to us and then we'll go from there.
